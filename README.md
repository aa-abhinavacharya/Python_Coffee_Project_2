# Project : Coffee Trade Analysis for a Major Industry Player

### Note :- All the files used for data analysis are present in the repository. Project is prepared with the help of the course in Udemy [Python Data Visualization: Matplotlib & Seaborn Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-pandas/) by Maven Analytics. Datasets are present in the link-[Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-data-visualization-matplotlib-seaborn/?srsltid=AfmBOop1YNPr3dWseg0L2AXe6v50HlWa4ne2Q7JMvhT3Fl-q7DuIaszj).

## Project Brief :- A major global coffee trader has approached in seeking independent, data-driven insights into coffee production, with a particular focus on Brazilâ€™s position relative to other coffee-producing nations. This request signals a strategic review of their sourcing practices and cost structures in an increasingly competitive and volatile market. Continuing further analysis from part 1. [Link](https://github.com/aa-abhinavacharya/Python_Coffee_Project_1).

### Objective Brief :- Summarize the findings obtained from the part 1 of this project and preparing few more type of vizualisations to effectively communicate findings from the data.

## Objectives :-

1. Read in data from multiple csv files.

2.Reshape the data with Pandas to set up charts .

3. Build and customize line charts, bar charts, histograms and more to communicate key insights to our client.

4. Modify chart colors to represent national flags

5. Combine modified charts into a single report by leveraging meshgrid and subplots

## How the insights help us in coffee industry analysis ?

#### Meshgrid Layout â€“ Brazil's Place in Global Coffee Market

This single figure report brings together all critical elements to give a comprehensive view of Brazil's production role:

ðŸ”˜ Donut Charts (Brazil's Share: 1990 vs 2018)
Insight: Brazilâ€™s dominance has changed over time â€” these visuals highlight whether its share has declined, grown, or remained stable.

Usage: Shows if Brazil is still the global leader or being outpaced â€” helps the client decide whether to rely or diversify sourcing.

ðŸ“‰ Stackplot (Brazil vs. Rest of World)
Insight: A temporal comparison showing how Brazilâ€™s production scales with global output.

Usage: Useful for forecasting and identifying if Brazilâ€™s growth is aligned with global trends or lagging.

ðŸ“Š Bar Chart & Pie Chart (Top 5 Producers + Others)
Insight: Helps rank the top producers and visualizes how production is distributed.

Usage: Helps stakeholders see where volume is concentrated â€” essential for supply chain planning and risk mitigation.

ðŸŽ¨ Country-Specific Colors & rcParams Styling
Insight: Makes the chart easy to interpret and visually appealing for executive-level sharing.

Usage: Improves readability and makes this figure shareable in stakeholder decks, meetings, or investor presentations.

#### Subplots â€“ Prices Paid to Growers

Create a grid of histograms for:

Brazil

Colombia

Ethiopia

All other nations

ðŸ“ˆ Price Distribution Histograms
Insight: Shows the range and average prices paid to growers across different countries. For example, if Brazil has a tighter or lower distribution, it may be more cost-efficient.

Usage: Helps determine pricing advantage or risks. Countries with higher variability might pose supply chain instability, while stable countries offer predictability in sourcing costs.

### Overall Strategic Value :- 

Together, these visualizations:

1. Provide a holistic, time-aware view of Brazil's global role.

2. Allow for data-backed sourcing decisions based on market dominance, growth trajectory, and production efficiency.

3. Help the client visually communicate insights to internal teams and external stakeholders with a single, well-designed report.
